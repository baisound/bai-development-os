## Current Product Boundary

BAI Development OS is standalone. Consumer projects do not host OS Core. Registry/index/dashboard/preview/distributed transport state is derived or coordination state and never replaces Canonical Product, Lifecycle, Knowledge, Security, Release, Conformance, Maintenance, Calibration or Owner authority.

## Current DistributedOS Baseline

TASK-015 is `COMPLETED`. `DistributedOS` is an optional coordination layer: versioned Event Envelopes, at-least-once durable delivery, consumer-idempotent effects, worker capability/attestation, exact-scope lease/epoch/fencing, remote request/result binding, stale-result quarantine, retry/DLQ/replay, Saga compensation, distributed metric/SLO aggregation, partition fail-closed behavior, quota/backpressure, staged canary/soak/rollback, policy-divergence detection, distributed Calibration Evidence and tamper-evident local checkpoint receipts. Distributed mode is disabled by default.

## Verification

- TASK-015 Distributed suite: `73 / 73 PASS`
- Full BAI Development OS: `1238 / 1238 PASS` (TASK-016 Phase 0 RC2 closure candidate; prior baselines preserved)
- JavaScript Roulette Consumer: `10 / 10 PASS`
- Distributed Conformance: `10 schemas / 13 shared contracts PASS`
- Extension / Calibration / Maintenance / Conformance / Release / Security Conformance: `PASS`
- Product Boundary: `PASS`
- Roadmap Consolidation: `56 / 56 PASS` after CREATIVE OS Knowledge Audit refinement synchronization
- Root `DistributedOS` export: `PASS`
- TASK-016 Phase 0 Knowledge Evolution focused suite: `50 / 50 PASS`
- Root `KnowledgeEvolutionOS` export: `PASS`
- Product-owned Python reference compile + local Mock Hub smoke: `PASS`
- Blocking Critic findings: `0`
- Document Registry: `534 documents / Missing 0 / Hash-Size mismatch 0`
- Detailed Design DOCX visual QA: `9 / 9 PASS`
- Architecture Ver.2.28 DOCX visual QA: `153 / 153 PASS` (86 inherited pages pixel-identical to Ver.2.27; 67 changed/reflowed/new pages individually reviewed)

## Accepted Residual

Production-specific remote broker implementations, real remote workers/labs, multi-region deployment, cloud provisioning and vendor-specific distributed adapters remain Extension/Integration deployments behind completed TASK-015 contracts. The explicit Owner decision now creates TASK-016 only for reusable resilience/recovery/scalability certification; provider deployment does not move into Core. TASK-016 Phase 0 is Owner-authorized; TASK-016 Phase 1+ remains unauthorized.


## TASK-016 Phase 0 Closure Baseline

TASK-016 Phase 0 is `COMPLETED`. RC2 froze canonical Consumer Evidence Event/Batch/Receipt/Client Policy v1, closed Event Catalog, Privacy/Forbidden Fields, Object Storage Artifact Profile, Product-owned Python integration technology and immutable Git Repository Snapshot Reference. BAI VIDEO PRODUCTION GitHub commit/tree provenance was validated with `KEY_FILES_ONLY` content coverage and derived sanitized Evidence/Candidates; no raw Product repository or credential was committed.

Phase 0 Judge: `PHASE0_COMPLETED / NEXT_ROUTE_ELIGIBLE`. Production Hub infrastructure is not a Phase 0 blocker and moves to TASK-017 Phase 0/deployment scope. TASK-016 Phase 1+ remains unauthorized until the Hub/client pilot produces resilience targets/evidence.
